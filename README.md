If you want to make a voice recognition enabled game in Unity (for iPhone only) these two files are put into Unity.  There are comments in each file on where to put them and what settings you will need in xcode.  I used this code for my free game 'Wizard Fight'.  A basic overview of how it works is that the swift file does the voice recognition, then that sends a message to the SpeechController.cs file which controls the unity game.
